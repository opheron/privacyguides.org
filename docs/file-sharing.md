## File Sharing

### OnionShare

    ![OnionShare logo](/assets/img/file-sharing-sync/onionshare.svg){ align=right }

    **OnionShare** is an open-source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share a file of any size. It works by starting a web server accessible as a Tor onion service, with an unguessable URL that you can share with the recipients to download or send files.

## File Sync

### Syncthing

!!! recommendation

    ![Syncthing logo](/assets/img/file-sharing-sync/syncthing.svg){ align=right }

    **Syncthing** replaces proprietary sync and cloud services with something open, trustworthy, and decentralized. Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, if it is shared with some third-party, and how it is transmitted over the Internet.

### git-annex

!!! recommendation

    ![git-annex logo](/assets/img/file-sharing-sync/gitannex.svg){ align=right }

    **git-annex** allows managing files with git, without checking the file contents into git. While that may seem paradoxical, it is useful when dealing with files larger than git can currently easily handle, whether due to limitations in memory, time, or disk space.
