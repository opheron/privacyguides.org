Encryption of data is the only way to control who can access it. If you are currently not using encryption software for your hard disk, emails, or files, you should pick an option here.

## Multi-platform

The options listed here are multi-platform and great for creating encrypted backups of your data.

### VeraCrypt

    **VeraCrypt** is a source-available freeware utility used for on-the-fly encryption. It can create a virtual encrypted disk within a file, encrypt a partition, or encrypt the entire storage device with pre-boot authentication. VeraCrypt is a fork of the discontinued TrueCrypt project. According to its developers, security improvements have been implemented and issues raised by the initial TrueCrypt code audit have been addressed.

    Truecrypt has been [audited a number of times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt#Security_audits) and VeraCrypt has also been [audited seperately](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VeraCrypt#VeraCrypt_audit).

    !!! attention
        When encrypting with VeraCrypt, the user has the option to select from different [hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VeraCrypt#Encryption_scheme). We suggest users **only** select [SHA-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-512) and should stick to the [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) block cipher.

### GNU Privacy Guard

!!! recommendation

    ![GNU Privacy Guard logo](/assets/img/encryption-software/gnupg.svg){ align=right }

    **GnuPG** is a GPL-licensed alternative to the PGP suite of cryptographic software. GnuPG is compliant with [RFC 4880](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880), which is the current IETF specification of OpenPGP. The GnuPG project has been working on an [updated draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh/) in an attempt to modernize [PGP's shortcomings](https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html). GnuPG is a part of the Free Software Foundation's GNU software project, and has received major [funding](https://gnupg.org/blog/20220102-a-new-future-for-gnupg.html) from the German government.

    ??? tip "Future default"
        When [generating keys](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/c14.html) we suggest using the `future-default` command as this will instruct GnuPG use modern cryptography such as [Curve25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519#History) and [ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/).
        ```
        gpg --quick-gen-key alice@example.com future-default
        ```

### Cryptomator

!!! recommendation

    ![Cryptomator logo](/assets/img/encryption-software/cryptomator.svg){ align=right }

    **Cryptomator** makes it easy for you to upload files to the cloud in a virtual encrypted file system.

    Some of the Cryptomator Crypto Libraries have been [audited](https://cryptomator.org/open-source/) by [Cure53](https://cryptomator.org/audits/2017-11-27%20crypto%20cure53.pdf). The scope of those libraries included [cryptolib](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib), [cryptofs](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs), [siv-mode](https://github.com/cryptomator/siv-mode) and [cryptomator-objc-cryptor](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-objc-cryptor).

    ![Picocrypt logo](/assets/img/encryption-software/picocrypt.svg){ align=right }

    **Picocrypt** is a small and simple encryption tool that provides modern encryption. Picocrypt uses the secure XChaCha20 cipher and the Argon2id key derivation function to provide a high level of security. It uses Go's standard x/crypto modules for its encryption features.

## Operating system included Full Disk Encryption (FDE)

Modern operating systems include [disk encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_encryption) and will utilize a [secure cryptoprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_cryptoprocessor).

### BitLocker

!!! recommendation

    ![BitLocker logo](/assets/img/encryption-software/bitlocker.png){ align=right }

    **BitLocker** is the default full volume encryption that comes with Microsoft Windows. The main reason we recommend it is because of its [use of TPM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/how-windows-uses-the-tpm). [ElcomSoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElcomSoft), a forensics company, has written about it in [Understanding BitLocker TPM Protection](https://blog.elcomsoft.com/2021/01/understanding-BitLocker-tpm-protection/).

    !!! note
        BitLocker is [only supported](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-on-device-encryption-0c453637-bc88-5f74-5105-741561aae838) on Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions of Windows. It can be enabled on Home editions provided that they meet the prequesites.

    ??? tip "Enabling BitLocker on Windows Home"
        To enable BitLocker on "Home" editions of Windows, you must partitions formatted with formatted with a [GUID Partition Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table) and have a dedicated [TPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module) (v1.2, 2.0+) module.

        1. Open Windows [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell). Start "PowerShell"

        2. Check to see partition table format:
           ```
           powershell Get-Disk 0 | findstr GPT && echo This is a GPT system disk!
           ```

        3. Check TPM version. The value returned must be "3 True". The spec must be 1.2 or above.
           ```
           powershell Get-WmiObject -Namespace "root/cimv2/security/microsofttpm" -Class WIN32_tpm | findstr "IsActivated IsEnabled IsOwned SpecVersion"
           ```

        4. Access Windows 10 "Advanced Startup Options". (Press "reboot" while holding shift button). *Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > Command Prompt*

        5. Login with your account that has admin privileges and type this to start encryption:
           ```
           manage-bde -on c: -used
           ```

        6. Close the command prompt, and enter into PowerShell:
        ```
        manage-bde c: -protectors -add -rp -tpm
        manage-bde -protectors -enable c:
        manage-bde -protectors -get c: > %UserProfile%\Desktop\BitLocker-Recovery-Key.txt
        ```

        !!! warning
            Backup `BitLocker-Recovery-Key.txt` on a separate storage device. Loss of this recovery code, may result in loss of data.

### FileVault

!!! recommendation

    ![FileVault logo](/assets/img/encryption-software/filevault.png){ align=right }

    **FileVault** is the on-the-fly disk encryption that comes with macOS. We recommend it because tightly intergrates with the [Apple T2 Security Chip](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/volume-encryption-with-filevault-sec4c6dc1b6e/1/web/1).

### Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS)

!!! recommendation

    ![LUKS logo](/assets/img/encryption-software/luks.png){ align=right }

    **LUKS** is the default full disk encryption method for Linux. It can be used to encrypt full volumes, partitions, or create encrypted containers.

    ??? "Creating and opening encrypted containers"
        ```
        dd if=/dev/urandom of=/path-to-file bs=1M count=1024 status=progress
        sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /path-to-file
        ```

        #### Opening encrypted containers
        We recommend opening containers and volumes with `udisksctl` as this uses [Polkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polkit). Most file managers, such as those included with popular desktop environments, can unlock encrypted files. Tools like [udiskie](https://github.com/coldfix/udiskie) can run in the system tray and provide a helpful user interface.
        ```
        udisksctl loop-setup -f /path-to-file
        udisksctl unlock -b /dev/loop0
        ```

    !!! Warning "Back up volume headers"
        We recommend you always [back up your LUKS headers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Device_encryption#Backup_and_restore) in case of partial drive failure. This can be done with:

        ```
        cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /dev/device --header-backup-file /mnt/backup/file.img
        ```
