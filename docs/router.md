    **OpenWrt** is an operating system (in particular, an embedded operating system) based on the Linux kernel, primarily used on embedded devices to route network traffic. The main components are the Linux kernel, util-linux, uClibc, and BusyBox. All components have been optimized for size, to be small enough for fitting into the limited storage and memory available in home routers.

    !!! note
        Consult the [Table of Hardware](https://openwrt.org/toh/start) to check if your device is supported.

    pfSense is an open source firewall/router computer software distribution based on FreeBSD. It is installed on a computer to make a dedicated firewall/router for a network and is noted for its reliability and offering features often only found in expensive commercial firewalls. pfSense is commonly deployed as a perimeter firewall, router, wireless access point, DHCP server, DNS server, and VPN endpoint.
