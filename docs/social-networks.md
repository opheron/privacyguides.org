    Mastodon is a social network based on open web protocols and free, open-source software. It is decentralized like email, users can exist on different servers or even different platforms but still communicate with each other. It also has the most users, and the most diverse (in terms of interests) users, it looks good, and it is easy to setup yourself.

    diaspora\* is based on three key philosophies: Decentralization, Freedom, and Privacy. It is intended to address privacy concerns related to centralized social networks by allowing users set up their own server (or "pod") to host content. Pods can then interact to share status updates, photographs, and other social data.
