Stay safe and secure online with an encrypted and open-source password manager.

## Password best practices

- Always use unique passwords. Don't make yourself a victim of "[credential stuffing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing)".
- Store an exported backup of your passwords in an [encrypted container](/file-encryption) on another storage device. This can be useful if something happens to your device or the service you are using.
- If possible store [Time-based one-time password (TOTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password) tokens in a separate [TOTP app](/multi-factor-authentication) and not your password manager. TOTP codes are generated from a "[shared secret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password#Security)". If the secret is obtained by an adversary they can generate TOTP values. Typically, mobile platforms have better app isolation and more secure methods for storing sensitive credentials.

## Local Password Managers

These password managers store the password database locally.

    ![KeepassXC logo](/assets/img/password-management/keepassxc.svg){ align=right }

    **KeePassXC** is a community fork of KeePassX, a native cross-platform port of KeePass Password Safe, with the goal to extend and improve it with new features and bugfixes to provide a feature-rich, fully cross-platform and modern open-source password manager.

    !!! warning
